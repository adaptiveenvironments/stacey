  A friend got obsessed with the socalled Maya Prophecy. This motivated a music performance about a possible end of the world. We travelled to Yucatan to meet the Mayas. I brought along a 3D video camera. They told us that the roumors of armageddon were highly exaggerated.
  
  Deborah Vlaeymans composed the music and performed the songs. I created a mobile 3D cinema, that could travel Copenhagen on a cargo bike.
  
  We combined the stereoscopic illusion of depth with realtime stereographic animations.
