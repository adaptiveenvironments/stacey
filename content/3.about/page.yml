 <p>Ole Kristensen is a visual artist, programmer and scenographer. At the intersection of art and science he develops and appropriates new technology, creating works with software at the core.</p>
 <p>His work ranges from stage performances and modern dance to large scale interactive installations. In his work he focuses on the behavioural aspects of interactivíty, adaptivity, and generativity. </p>
 <p>He is driven by a playful urge to connect electronics, gadgets, visuals and moving objects in seemingly impossible combinations. Through his visual arts practice he has gained knowledge in diverse fields within engineering and programming.</p>
 <p>He is working in the dance company <a href="http://recoil-performance.org/">Recoil Performance Group</a> and the performance group <a href="http://in-transit.org">IN-TRANSIT</a>.</p>
 <p>He is researching, teaching and giving workshops at the <a href="http://scenekunstskolen.dk/">Danish National School of Performing Arts</a>, <a href="http://kadk.dk">The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts Schools of Architecture, Design and Conservation (KADK)</a>, and <a href="http://itu.dk">The IT University of Copenhagen</a>.</p>

 <p>Selected exhibitions and performances include Renew Festival (Copenhagen), New Media Days (Norrköping), ZKM (Karlsruhe), Dansehallerne (Copenhagen), Interarte Festival (Rio de Janiero), Nikolaj Kunsthal / Copenhagen Contemporary Art Center, Roskilde Festival and more.</p>
 <p>His work in Recoil Performance Group has twice received the <a href="http://www.aaretsreumert.dk">National Danish Theare Award</a> for best Dance Performance.</p>
 <p>From an early age Ole was driven by his fascination of Graphic Design. Much of his childhood in the rural town of Ringsted was spent in front of the screen doing elaborate typographic designs and programming intricate menu systems.</p>
 <p>He was already working artisticly when he finished a BSc in Computer Science and Communications at Roskilde University in 2000. His projects had transformed into large scale immersive installations in the university's television studio. From there on he continued into visual arts, installation and performance via guest studies at the Art and Technology master at Chalmers University in Gothenburg and the Halfmachine festivals in Christiania.</p>

 <blockquote><p>It is a great pleasure to create something that can react, adapt, and generate new forms from itself or it's surroundings. My main interest lies in this creation of dynamic aestetic phenomena. When an artwork is running software the challenge is to make the behavioural aspects of the piece constitute it's aestetic qualities. </p></blockquote>
