abstract: | # Max 150 words - is shown on website
  Adaptive lighting integrates user scenarios, daylight variations and architectural qualities in the design of light and controlsystems. The project works with issues involving the following PSO 2015 focus areas: energy efficiency of existing buildings, with a focus on lighting, through the involvement of (3a) LED lighting and (3b) Control and regulation of light. The project contributes to the development of  functional and well-designed adaptive lighting solutions, which dynamically regulates the intensity and color composition of light with individual and place-specific solutions. A special focus will be on solutions that integrate daylight as a formative parameter of the adaptive lightcontrol.

  Adaptive lighting design<br>
  The new possibilities offered is adaption seen from the consumer's perspective: that the environment adapts to the personal wishes and needs, and that this is done within the framework of architectural lighting design that takes into account the energy consumption. The project develops sketch tools that can facilitate the design considerations across the value chain, and enable exchange and cooperation through the design of concrete adaptive installations and analysis of user behaviour. The project will contribute to improve the development of adaptive lighting design, providing knowledge and tools to enhance adaptive design qualities.
