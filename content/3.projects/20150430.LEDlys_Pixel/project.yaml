summary: | # Max 50 words - is shown on website and screen presentations (eg. the Atrium Displays) All paragraphs start with two white-spaces.
  This project about the quality of LED lighting is one of four that were conducted as part of the project entitled LED Lighting; Interdisciplinary LED Lighting Research. The research project has been a three-year collaboration between The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts; Schools of Architecture, Design and Conservation and The IT University of Copenhagen.

  In this project our interest has been in identifying how the qualities of LEDs can be used in lighting applications. With experiences in the planning and implementation of architectural lighting design in practice, one quickly experiences and realises that there are untapped potentials in the attributes of LED technology. In this research, speculative studies have been made working with the attributes of LEDs in architectural contexts, with the ambition to ascertain new strategies for using LED lighting in lighting design practice. The speculative experiments that have been set-up have aimed to clarify the variables that can be used as parameters in the design of lighting applications; including, for example, the structuring and software control of light. The experiments also elucidate and exemplify already well-known problems in relation to the experience of vertical and horizontal lighting. Pixel Experiments exist as a synergy between speculative test setups and lighting design in practice.
