  This PhD explores the design of kinetic architecture in the context of the adaptive built environment. 
  
abstract: | # Max 150 words - is shown on website
  The PhD project investigates how computational paradigms such as generative design and artificial intelligence have the persistence to outlive the design stage of architectural and engineering practice. With the standardisation of Building Information Modelling, and the significance these models gain in the operational stage of the built environment the transition from abstract design to concrete reality has become a continuing dialogue. This means not only that the chronological order of traditional phases such as design, construction and built is put to question, but also that the relations between Designers, Users and Systems could be redefined. Supporting trends are the infusion of information technology in the fabric of every-day life, the sophistication of building technology and modern fabrication techniques that allow for mass-customisation of building components, and consequently for individually tailored architecture.
