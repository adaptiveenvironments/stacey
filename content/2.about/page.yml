  I create art by writing software for computers and building electronics.
  
  I work in the arts with performance, set design, visual art and installation. I also teach and work in academic research.

 My main interests lies in the creation of dynamic aestetic phenomena. When running software it behaves in certain ways over time, depending on what input it can interpret. I love working with software as a form of coded aestetic behaviour. It is a great pleasure to create something dynamic that can react, adapt, and generate new forms from itself or it's surroundings.
 
 It is primarily visuals, movement and light that forms the output of my work. On the stage I work with infrared tracking, stereography and videoprojections. But the secret sauce is the software that can react to it's surroundings. 
 
 I work with art- and dance groups, but I also thrive in experimental research environments where there is room for exchanging both crazy, grand or silly ideas. Keeping curiosity alive is a priority for me. One of the most inspiring tasks is to teach what I know. Workshop students simply never seizes to amaze.
 
 To believe that outcomes have reasons that i can never know in their entirety is enough to me. I'd rather wonder if a newborn does not know itself from it's surroundings than put my faith in stories about good vs. evil, a supreme being, the immutable order of things, or fate.
